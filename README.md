	The primary kernel (heart of the program!)
	
	Each pixel p in the RGBA image is a struct of four unsigned chars:
	
		- p.x Which is the red channel number.
	
		- p.y The green channel.
	
		- p.z The blue channel.
	
		- p.w The alpha channel (which we ignore).
	
	For each greyscale pixel to be created we calculate this formula:
	
		p = .299*p.x + .587*p.y + .114*p.z
	
	The output is a single char because we only have one channel.
	
	In the kernel each thread is responsible for calculating the mentioned
	
	formula for each pixel and the put the result into the greyscale
	
	image placehold.
	
	First we find out where the thread (pixel) is and then we do the
	
	above.
